<h1>Blockchain</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine a transparent and immutable database. Accessible and verifiable
by anyone, anytime and anywhere in the world with an internet connection.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine a database that is decentralized enough that no single entity
can have control or illegally modify the records, shut it down or take
it offline.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine a database that is that can contain snippets of self-executing
code that can be uploaded by anyone, with great composability against other
snippets of code that can create a thriving, vibrant ecosystem of such
snippets of code.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Such code will stay dormant until called upon by someone and any changes
to the code's storage will be recorded on the database. Some snippets even
have underlying real world assets backing them, which can be claimed. Think
of it as a vending machine, it does nothing until someone put money in
and select a drink.</p>
<p>
<br>In this technology of Blockchain, such a future is already possible. We
call such snippets of code Smart Contracts. We no longer need to rely on
trust alone. In fact, we rely on verifying with our own eyes with immutable
transactions on an immutable database instead.</p>

<p>With integrations by financial industry giants such as <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Circle (USDC)</a>,
redeemable for 1 US Dollar Bill for every 1 USDC held anytime, long gone
are days of bank transfers across the world that can take days or even
weeks, sometimes ending up in failure just because you missed out a digit,
alphabet in the details, lets not talk about the outrageous fees that can
possibly incur in the middle. In blockchain, seconds is all you need to
send money anywhere, anytime, instantaneously.</p>

<p>There are several use cases on can you do with real world assets on the
blockchain. Developers all around the world have already created a vibrant
ecosystem of applications on the Blockchain that mimic multiple sectors,
especially traditional finance. Applications such as Lending / Borrowing
that provides yield without any middleman taking a cut, Spot / Futures
Trading, Tokenized Stocks, Options for blue chip assets (for eg, Ethereum)
and Auctions.</p>

year, the MAS conducted its first test. J.P. Morgan, DBS Bank and SBI Digital
Asset Holdings used the Aave protocol on Polygon—a layer-2 scaling solution—to
complete foreign exchange and government bond transactions on the Ethereum
network.</p>

<p>The use cases are endless, and the nature of the technology is definitely
promising, with endless possibility. In fact, Government all around the
world are exploring the usage of Blockchains to integrate with numerous
sectors.</p>

which signalled the nation's interest in exploring such technology especially
on asset tokenization, tokenized funds with banking powerhouses such as
JPMorgan and Apollo Global.</p>
