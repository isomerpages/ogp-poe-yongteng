<h1>Blockchain</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine a network of computers, each with containing a immutable and transparent
database, constantly in sync with each other and is accessible and verifiable
by anyone, anytime and anywhere in the world with an internet connection.
A database that is decentralized enough that no single entity can have
control or illegally modify the records, shut it down or take it offline.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That database can contain snippets of self-executing code that can be
uploaded by anyone, with great composability against other snippets of
code to create a thriving, vibrant ecosystem of such snippets of code.
We call such snippets of code is smart contracts, and its written in a
langauge called Solidity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These smart contracts stay dormant until triggered by someone interacts
with it by a transaction, or with even smart contracts, and any changes
to the code's storage will be recorded on the database that can be seen
by the whole world. Some codes even have underlying real world assets backing
them, which can be claimed. Think of it as a vending machine, it does nothing
until someone put money in and select a drink.</p>
<p>
<br>With the technology of Blockchain, such a future is already possible.
We no longer need to rely on trust alone but by relying on verifying IT
with our very own eyes with transactions on an immutable database instead.</p>

<p>With integrations by financial industry giants such as <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Circle (USDC)</a>,
whose tokens are redeemable for 1 US Dollar Bill for every 1 USDC token
held anytime, long gone are days of bank transfers across the world that
can take days or even weeks, sometimes ending up in failure just because
you missed out a digit, alphabet in the details, In blockchain, seconds
is all you need to send money anywhere, anytime, instantaneously without
any commission in the multiple layers of middleman.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are several use cases on can you do with real world assets on the
blockchain. Developers all around the world have already created a vibrant
ecosystem of applications on blockchains that mimic multiple sectors, especially
traditional finance. Applications such as Lending / Borrowing that provides
yields, Spot / Futures Trading, Tokenized Stocks, Options for blue chip
assets (for eg, Ethereum) etc.</p>

year, the MAS conducted its first test. J.P. Morgan, DBS Bank and SBI Digital
Asset Holdings used the Aave protocol on Polygon—a layer-2 scaling solution—to
complete foreign exchange and government bond transactions on the Ethereum
network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use cases are endless, and the nature of the technology is definitely
promising, with endless possibility. In fact, Government all around the
world are exploring the usage of Blockchains to integrate with numerous
sectors.</p>

<p>Most notably, Singapore's MAS took part in <a href="https://decrypt.co/206153/jp-morgan-onyx-avalanche-tokenized-funds-avax" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Project Guardian</a>,
which signaled the nation's interest in exploring such technology especially
on asset tokenization, tokenized funds along with banking powerhouses such
as JPMorgan and Apollo Global to replace the current applications we are
current using.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I personally believe blockchain is a technology that can be integrated
into many of our everyday products to improve in so many areas such as
proving fraud, identity, banking, financial products etc. It is a space
worth exploring and integrating into the world we now know.</p>
